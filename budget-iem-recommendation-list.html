    <h1>Budget IEM Recommendation List</h1>


    <p>This is a recommendation list for IEMs under and around 100$. It is recommended to choose one of the cheaper IEMs and EQ that set of IEMs by preference, then choose one of the IEMs which fit the description of the preferred sound signature. You can still ask the sender for help, which one to choose, when you like a specific kind of sound.</p>

    <p>If you don't have any preference in terms of sound signatures, choose the one which aesthetically looks the best for you.</p>

    <p>As always, please check the pricings in your country, as they may differ from the price on this list. The IEMs here are listed at their MSRP.</p>
